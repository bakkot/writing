<div class="content">
  <p>An incomplete list of informative and/or cool science demos you can do for your kids and/or yourself.</p>
  <p>This is not intended to be a complete list. Selection criteria are that each demonstration needs to show some interesting phenomenon and be practical to reproduce with relatively little in the way of expenses or technical skill. Some of these can be done in thirty seconds if you have the materials on hand; some take much longer.</p>
  <p>For each project I've embedded a video which shows the project, but may omit details (e.g. quantities); you may need to Google.</p>
  <p>I'm always interested in collecting more of these. Please email [my username] @ gmail, or open an issue or PR <a href="https://github.com/bakkot/writing">on Github</a>.</p>
  <p>In no particular order.</p>

  <h3 id="cloud-chamber">

    Cloud chamber particle visualizer
  </h3>
  <p>With some dry ice plus materials you likely have around the house, you can see tracks from cosmic rays.</p>

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Many other versions on Youtube, some of which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cu3wW8rNAs">don't require</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt3Ad5_Z5IA">dry ice</a>.
      <li>As a bonus, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwYSvzojFbo">add a piece of radioactive material</a> to see many more tracks coming off of the material.
      <li>Takes a few minutes for the alcohol vapor to condense enough; be patient.

    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#polarize-colors" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Polarize light with sugar water, make colors
  </h3>
  <p>By shining light through a polarizing filter, then a solution of sugar water, then another polarizing filter, you can get colored light from white, with the color depending on the angle between the filters and the depth of the solution.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKVN9f_2aXg" title="Corn Syrup polarization rainbow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Heavily saturated sugar water works as well as corn syrup; use whichever is easier.
      <li>3blue1brown has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCX62YJCmGk">fancier demo and a detailed explanation.</a>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="three-filters">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#three-filters" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Three polarizing filters
  </h3>
  <p>Polarizing filters don't just filter light; they actually act on it. You can let more light through by adding an additional filter in the right way. Takes five seconds to demo if you have the filters on hand.</p>

  <h3 id="water-diamagnetism">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#water-diamagnetism" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Water is diamagnetic
  </h3>
  <p>You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism">push on</a> water with a magnet. The effect is weak, so a good magnet and setup is essential. </p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyqOTJOJSoU" title="&quot;Anti&quot; Magnetic water and Levitating Graphite by Diamagnetism" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of using a test tube as in the above video, you can fill a bottle cap full of water and float it on a small square of styrofoam.
      <li>You can also demonstrate it using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwbYgsrNk-A">the light-distorting effect of water</a>.</a>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="magnet-copper-tube">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#magnet-copper-tube" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Drop a magnet down a copper tube
  </h3>
  <p>Magnets fall slower when dropped through a conductive tube.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7tIi71-AjA" title="Lenz&#39;s Law with Copper Pipe" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>In this and all other demos, use a strong neodymium magnet.
      <li>You can get copper pipe from a home improvement store. They'll usually cut it for you; a foot is a good length.
      <li>You want the pipe to be about 2x the diameter of your magnet: as small as you can get it while still being able clearly see the magnet not touching the walls.
      <li>It's possible to demonstrate the Lenz effect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk4ACjzDFRY">with just a magnet and an aluminum can</a>, but it's not as impressive as the pipe.
      <li>It's also possible to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1pfeheZ74">a wire wrapped around a non-conductive tube</a>, which can light up an LED with the induced current. This will require a <em>lot</em> of turns of wire, though. Because the LED is a diode, only one choice of orientation of the magnet when dropping will work to light it up (I think).
    </ul>

  <h3 id="rainbow-chocolate">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#rainbow-chocolate" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Rainbow chocolate with diffraction grating
  </h3>
  <p>Diffraction grating is a nanoscale physical pattern which splits light by wavelength. You can transfer the pattern to choclate to get very pretty oil-slick rainbow patterns.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoTi0tM4yQ8" title="Optical Chocolate - Making Diffraction Gratings" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>The process is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Z2t_eNXFA">somewhat fiddly</a>.
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1491443125671571458">Here's another example</a> with written instructions.
      <li>Diffraction grating is cheap and cool, but be careful handling it: the oil from your hands is enough to disrupt the effect.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="microwave-c">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#microwave-c" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Measuring the speed of light with a microwave
  </h3>
  <p>By using the wavelength of your microwave and measuring the distace between hot spots in your food, you can calculate the speed of light.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH5W6xEeY5U" title="How To Calculate The Speed Of Light With Your Microwave" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>You'll have to trust the frequency printed on the microwave.
      <li>Videos of the process make it seem like you'll get a precise result, but in practice there's a pretty wide range of plausible distances between dead spots you might measure. But you should still get the right order of magnitude.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="fizeau-apparatus">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#fizeau-apparatus" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Measuring the speed of light the original way
  </h3>
  <p>If you don't want to trust the number printed on your microwave, it's possible - with a lot more work - to actually physically observe lightspeed delay, using a rapidly spinning disk with holes and a laser shining across several miles.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMO9uUsjXaI" title="Measuring the speed of light the old fashioned way: Replicating the Fizeau Apparatus" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>This is a lot more work than most projects on this page. I've included it anyway because it is <em>so cool</em>.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="microwave-plasma">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#microwave-plasma" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Making plasma in the microwave
  </h3>
  <p>Microwaving a lit match (among other options) will make plasma.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKIAkPzLskY" title="Microwave Plasma" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wCrtk-pyP0I">Grapes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/l0u8Vtf2GoQ?t=1336">aluminum foil</a> also work, and with slightly different effects.
      <li>The plasma is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGqVMbAQhBs">very hot and can damage the integrity of the glass used to trap it</a>, so you should probably use something disposable (e.g. an old mason jar) and throw it out after.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="double-slit">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#double-slit" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    The double slit experiment
  </h3>
  <p>With a laser and a piece of hair, you can see interference patterns which have no classical explanation. A proper double slit works a little better but is not necessary.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_uBaBuarEM" title="I did the double slit experiment at home" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Be careful with lasers. They're often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMVWW-bmKwQ">more powerful than they claim</a> and can do permanent damage to your eyes.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="gold-pennies">

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaGDdTKFTHY">chemistry of this reaction</a> is pretty interesting.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Working with bare wires and a serious power supply is dangerous; stick to a standard battery unless you know what you're doing.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="electricity-delay">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#electricity-delay" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Using an oscilloscope to watch electricity propagate when you flip a switch
  </h3>
  <p>If you run a kilometer of wire and have an oscilloscope, you can see some nontrivial behavior when closing a switch.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Vrhk5OjBP8" title="I bought 1000 meters of wire to settle a physics debate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>If you're going to run this experiment you should probably be the sort of person who already owns and knows how to use an oscilloscope.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="electricity-delay-in-water">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#electricity-delay-in-water" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Submerging a circuit in water makes electricity flow slower through it
  </h3>
  <p>This is just like the above experiment, but you put a pipe full of water water around part of the circuit and observe that it takes longer for the circuit to fully complete.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQIg5XeIgQ0" title="Why does WATER change the speed of electricity?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h3 id="refraction">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#refraction" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Light changes angle when passing through glass
  </h3>
  <p>Shining a laser pointer through a glass slab lets you easily visualize refraction.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/el8AUeZaljw" title="Refraction of Light Through a Glass Slab using Laser Beam || By Vinod Avnish" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h3 id="camera-obscura">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#camera-obscura" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Camera obscura
  </h3>
  <p>Cardboard and a lens lets you reproduce an image.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zd4F-N301bk" title="Make a Cardboard Camera Obscura" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>Tracing paper works well for the projection material. Wax paper might also work.
      <li>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nRpXeTflw">turn a whole room (with a window) into a camera obscura</a>; you don't even need a lens.
      <li>A good follow-up is to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mfpvwbc2F4">an actual camera</a>.
      <li>A simpler variation is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyjdIVRYbQE">project the image of a candle with a lens</a>. This requires only a candle, a lens, and a piece of paper. And because the light is basically a single color, you can use a simpler lens without worrying about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lens">chromatic abberation</a>.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="resonance">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#resonance" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Resonance
  </h3>
  <p>You can see resonance with a couple of tuning forks and a pingpong ball.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5H8aRCyEGnU" title="Tuning Fork Resonance A-level Physics" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>The wooden boxes in the video above make the effect stronger but are not strictly necessary; you just have to get the forks very close.
      <li>A variant of this is to physically hold the forks, so you can feel one start to move when the other is struck.
      <li>You can adjust the resonant frequency of a fork by sticking a magnet to it (or making similar adjustments for non-ferrous forks).
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="heat-expansion">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#heat-expansion" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Measuring expansion of metal due to heat
  </h3>
  <p>With a sufficiently precise measuring tool you can see metal expand  just from warming it up with body heat.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvfcMd0IXCA?start=1887" title="Adam Savage&#39;s Most Precise Measurement Tool!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>You need a <em>really</em> precise dial indicator. Try Mitutoyo. You also need gauge blocks or similarly precisely machined objects.
      <li>Try looking up the (linear) thermal expansion coefficient for your material and checking against what you see. Is the implied change in temperature plausible?
      <li>If you have the dial indicator, you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46DBNUfhATo">measure the thickness of a Sharpie mark</a>.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="cloud-in-a-bottle">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#cloud-in-a-bottle" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Cloud in a bottle
  </h3>
  <p>Add some smoke and water to a bottle, pump air in, then suddenly let it out and you get clouds. The effect is more dramatic with rubbing alcohol instead of water (but skip the smoke).</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXpuo3YHOn0" title="Cloud in the Bottle - The Spangler Effect" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeXuKd0vMRk">You can get a similar effect without a pump</a> by twisting a bottle to create the pressure.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="diet-coke-and-mentos">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#diet-coke-and-mentos" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Diet coke & Mentos
  </h3>
  <p>Drop Mentos candy in soda and get an eruption as the candy creates nucleation sites for the dissolved CO2. You've probably seen this but it's still cool.</p>
  <iframe loading=lazy width="680" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjbJELjLgZg" title="Diet Coke &amp; Mentos | MythBusters" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>This works just fine with soda water; you don't actually need diet Coke. I recommend against soda with sugar in it because it's a pain to clean and will attract ants.
      <li>The effect scales (within reason) with the number of Mentos - make a tube from a piece of paper to hold a stack and drop them all in one go.
      <li>Old soda loses some of its CO2, so this is best done with a new bottle.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="coloring-coal">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#coloring-coal" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Coloring coal
  </h3>
  <p>Soaking coal in a solution made from some cheap chemicals will give it very cool colors.</p>

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>You can buy coal, potassium ferrocyanide, ferric chloride, and sodium bisulfite from Amazon.
      <li>The original patent is <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/85/ca/10/980ea59d395020/US2129902.pdf">here</a>.

    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#unmixing-corn-syrup" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Unmixing corn syrup
  </h3>
  <p>Corn syrup is very viscous and has a very low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number">Reynolds number</a>, which means that it can be made to flow extremely consistently - so consistently that you can actually reverse the operation and most molecules will end up close to where they started.</p>

    Dissolving eggshells
  </h3>
  <p>Soaking an egg in vinegar for 24-48 hours will dissolve the shell while keeping the outer membrane intact.</p>

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>You might as well try a few at once - they're fragile and may break. It's still raw egg inside.
      <li>You can wash the remnants of the shell off with water.
    </ul>

  <h3 id="silver-eggs">
    <span class="anchor-box"><a href="#silver-eggs" class="sec-anchor">§</a></span>
    Coat an egg in soot
  </h3>
  <p>Coating an egg in soot will make it hydrophobic, which means if you dunk it in water it will have a skin of air.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TYvUdaLjRA&t=87s">This video</a> goes into detail about how to make one.
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnCmvxt2jn8">This</a> is a fan instead of a lifter based on the same principles. It links to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEVMO-400000V-Step-up-High-Voltage-Generator/dp/B07T3XDMH8">these 5V to 400kV transformers</a>, which frankly sounds a bit insane.
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lnIviZ9Aqs">Getting power from a USB battery pack</a> is one of the easier electronics projects, and should be sufficient to drive the above transformer.

      <li>Don't use mineral water; it needs to be pure.
      <li>2.5-3 hours seems to be the recommended length of time to keep the water in the freezer. It will freeze on its own eventually.
      <li>Try a few bottles at once; the process is delicate.

      <li>The video above uses graphite in cooking oil, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSTNxS96fRg">mica powder works well too</a>.
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuLX76g7Fec">This video</a> has a nice 2D version so you can see what's going on inside.

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>I don't have a video of someone doing this, but multiple amateurs have reported success (in addition to the original in 1919, of course). See <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/Bruns-SAS2016-paper-v6.pdf">this</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00343.pdf">this</a>. Authors are probably contactable if you need help.
      <li>Solar eclipses are rare. If you want to do this, make sure you still take time to experience the eclipse.
      <li>Many sources, including some which should know better, describe this experiment as proving Einstein right because it showed light bending at all. This is wrong: Newton's theory predicted that as well. But the theories produce different numbers. To do this experiment justice, you would ideally derive the numbers predicted by each theory yourself, so you could see which matches the data.
    </ul>
